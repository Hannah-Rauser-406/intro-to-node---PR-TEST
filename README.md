## Intro to Node:
### Notes:
__Node.jsÂ®__is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
A __node_module__ is basically a lego block of code. Everything in a node applications is modular, meaning it is made up of many different smaller parts that work towards the end functionality


__NPM__ stands for Node Package Manager. Its just a tool that allows us to easily access the node module and add them to our project.

every node app has a __package.json__ , which is the master file that keeps track of all node modules your project cares about
